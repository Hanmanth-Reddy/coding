## Spinnaker Services

### Spinnaker consists of multiple microservices, including:
```bash
•	Deck – UI frontend
•	Gate – API gateway
•	Front50 – Stores application/pipeline metadata
•	Rosco – Bakery service for image creation
•	Igor – Integrates with CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins)
•	Echo – Notification service
•	Fiat – Role-based access control (RBAC)
•	Kayenta – Automated canary analysis (optional)
•	Clouddriver – Manages cloud infrastructure
•	Orca – Orchestration engine for pipelines
```

### Deck – UI Frontend
```bash
The web-based user interface for Spinnaker.
Users interact with Spinnaker through Deck to configure applications, pipelines, and deployments.
Built using AngularJS and communicates with other services via the Gate API.
```
### Gate – API Gateway
```bash
Acts as the entry point for all Spinnaker API requests.
Exposes a REST API that allows external tools and users to interact with Spinnaker.
Handles authentication and authorization before forwarding requests to other microservices.
```
### Front50: Persistent Storage
```bash
Spinnaker uses Front50 to store application and pipeline configurations/metadata  such as. 
	•	Pipeline configurations
	•	Application settings
	•	Deployment history
Supported storage backends include:
	•	Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
	•	Amazon S3
	•	Azure Blob Storage
	•	MinIO (S3-compatible)
	•	Redis
	•	SQL Databases (MySQL, Postgres, etc.)
Configuring storage is crucial since Spinnaker relies on it to store metadata and pipeline states.
```

### Fiat – Authentication & Authorization
```bash
Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Spinnaker.
Supports multiple authentication methods, including:
	•	OAuth 2.0 (Google, GitHub, Azure, etc.)
	•	LDAP
	•	SAML
	•	x509 Certificates
Works with external identity providers to restrict access to Spinnaker resources.
For authorization, Spinnaker uses Fiat, which integrates with external identity providers to enforce role-based access control.
```

###Clouddriver – Cloud Infrastructure Management
```bash
•	Responsible for interacting with cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.).
•	Fetches real-time cloud resource information (instances, load balancers, security groups).
•	Executes deployments by creating, updating, or deleting cloud resources.
```

###Orca – Pipeline Orchestration Engine
```bash
The workflow engine that executes pipelines and deployment strategies.
Manages:
	•	Pipeline execution states
	•	Rollback strategies
	•	Stage dependencies
	•	Approval gates
Works closely with Clouddriver and Front50.
```

### Igor – CI/CD Integration
```bash
Bridges Spinnaker with CI/CD tools such as:
	•	Jenkins
	•	GitHub Actions
	•	Travis CI
	•	Google Cloud Build
	•	AWS CodeBuild
Triggers pipeline executions based on CI job results.
```
### Rosco – Image Bakery Service
```bash
•	Automates the creation of machine images (AMIs, VM images, etc.) for deployments.
•	Integrates with tools like Packer to bake images.
•	Used in environments where immutable infrastructure (pre-baked images) is a preferred deployment strategy
```

### Echo – Notification & Event Handling
```bash
•	Handles event-driven notifications in Spinnaker.
•	Can send alerts via:
	•	Slack
	•	Email
	•	SMS
	•	Webhooks
Also supports custom event listeners to trigger pipelines based on external events.
```

### Kayenta – Automated Canary Analysis (Optional)
```bash
•	Performs automated canary deployments by comparing new and existing versions of applications.
•	Uses metrics from monitoring tools (Prometheus, Datadog, Stackdriver, etc.) to detect performance regressions.
•	Helps in making data-driven release decisions.

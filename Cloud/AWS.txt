===========================================================
IAM
=================================================

1)AWS Account best practices 
2) Budget Alarms setup
AWS aws global infrastructure


IAM(identity and access Management):

Users, roles, groups, policies

least privileged access

IAM is global services, all global services hosted on north virginia(us-east-1) 
IAM is AWS managed service


Identity(user,group,role), Access(policies, predefined, Custom policies)

Identity federation - MicroSoft AD integration/ Facebook / Google / Amazon

Different ways to connect AWS:
------------------------------
AWS console
AWS Cli
SDK(Programatically) python,Java,.. etc
HTTP APIs(REST APIs)

choosing region:
-----------------
Pricing:
Available services:
Compliance: data goverance and legal requirements
Private regions: US govt, China
proxitimity: to customers, to reduce latency 



location-direction-launch time
us-east-1


Regions: 31
each regions containers atleast 3 AZ, there will be atleast 100km between AZ's.
Availaility zones : 99
3*AZ
Data centers 


======================
=======  VPC  ========
======================
entry Gate --> Internet Gateway

VPC -- regional specific 
Subnet is AZ specific

Subnetworks
Private Subnetworks
Public Subnetworks
Routers - 1 Private Subnet , 1 public Subnets
Internet GW attached Router and Subnets are Public Subnets 
Internet Gateway
NAT gateway GW

Security Groups (SG)  -- Server level
NACL (Network access control list)  -- network level

Bastion Host


=======================================
========== Virtualization =============
=======================================
Hypervization
Xen ( Open Source)
Nitro (AWS owned)


PVM - para virtulization
HVM - Hardware Virtulization 
SR - IOV Single root Input Output Virtualization


EC2 - elastic Compute Cloud 



==================
Storage
==================

Level of storage
1) File Level Storage   EFS(linux), FSx(windows) - files 
2) Block storage        EBK - blocks
3) Object storage       S3 - chunks 

S3 - is global service storage is regional

Storage Types:

DAS --> Direct attached storage
NAS --> Network attached Storage`
SAN --> Storage Area Network





------
JSON
-----

used for data exchange between servers 
Json used in AWS Cloud Formation/IAM policies /SCP (service control polices)
Keys mush be string, Values cab be a 1) string 2) number 3) boolean 4) null 5) Json 6) Array


============
Policies
============
Policies are used to manage permissions across AWS Types:
1)Identity based policies ( users, groups, roles)
2) Resources based policies (S3, KMS,SQS etc)
3) Permission boundaries 
4) Organization SCP's (service control polcies)
5) ACL's
6) Session policies 



#########Identity based policies ##########
To manage permissions of IAM indetities - Users , Groups, Roles
Allow/Deny , Deny has more priority over allow

Inline policies 
AWS managed 
Customer polcies  


{
"version:: "2012-10-17",
"statement": [ 
{
"sid": "S3 allow access"
"effect": "allow"
"action": ["s3": "list","s3": "create"]
"resource" : "*"
}
]
}

}

Practice - 1: 
Create Users, Groups attach polices and setup MFA


aws configure

Traffic Management

Load Balancing: Round Robin is the default load balancing algorithm in Istio.You donâ€™t need to explicitly define it because Istio uses it by default.you can configure load balancing algorithms and session affinity in the DestinationRule resource.
	Round Robin (default)
	Least Connection
	Random
	Weighted Least Request
Session Affinity:
Traffic Shifting:
Traffic Mirroring:

Security:
Mutual TLS (mTLS)
Service-to-Service Authentication
Authorization (RBAC)

5. Policy Enforcement
	Quota Management:
	Traffic Control Policies: You can set policies for circuit breakers, outlier detection, and other service-level policies
	Request Routing: You can control traffic flows, prioritize traffic, or limit access to certain endpoints.
